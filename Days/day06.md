If you made it this far then you will know if this is where you want to be or not. See you on [Day 7](day07.md). 

Day 7 will be us diving into a programming language, I am not aiming to be a developer but I want to be able to understand what the developers are doing. 

Can we achieve that in a week? Probably not but if we spend 7 days or 7 hours learning something we are going to know more than when we started.
