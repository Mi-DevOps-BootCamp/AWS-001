Now for the next 6 days of this topic my intention is to work through some of the resources listed above and document my notes for each day. You will notice that they are generally around 3 hours as a full course, I wanted to share my complete list so that if you have time you should move ahead and work through each one if time permits, I will be sticking to my learning hour each day. 

See you on [Day 8](day08.md).
